# Fighting MisInformation with Simple Data Analysis
I recently came across a tweet (https://twitter.com/CHSommers/status/1322226694099509251) that was liked 4k times and retweeted over 1.2k as of 11/01/2020 8 PM PST. I normally don't take tweets too seriously but this one admittedly got to me because it was intentially set up to mislead audiences albeit with amateur data manipulation techniques. It made it even worse because the author of the tweet was an ex-philosphy professor at Clark Univeristy who now works at AEI. So, I wrote an article on Medium to explain to a wide audience how simple manipulation of data could be used to mislead audiences.

  ##### Data from Department of Education, the same source the author of the tweet used
  ##### Python code for analysis of the data
